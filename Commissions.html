       ï»¿<p><b><i>IMPORTANT:</i> Everything I make is completely custom and some options, such as bone ash glazes require more time for testing.
  Please look on the <a href="https://animalemementomori.com/Our%20Process.html">process</a> page for details. Because of this it takes two to three months from time a deposit is placed until it ships. 
    Every piece I am commissioned for I take seriously and treat with respect. This takes time. </b></p>

<p><b>How do commissions work? All work requires a deposit. Deposits are 50% of the total price of the work sans shipping. Please take a look around and get an idea of what you want and email me 
  at commissions@animalementomori.com and I'll give you a deposit cost based on what you want. Once you agree I will send an invoice.</b></p>
  
  <p><b>After You've made a deposit I like to sit down on a half hour call or video call and discuss who you want to memorialize and what they were like.  What makes you smile when you think of them. Was there something that was special between the two of you.
  For example, I made a coffee mug with cremains in the clay and bone ash glaze.  A mug was selected becuase they would get up every morning, let their dog out and then have a cup of coffee. The mug is a way that they continue to spend the morning together.
Another person loved to make a big bowl of ramen, sit in the dark with her dog and watch a horror movie. So in there case I made a ramen bowl so she can still have ramen with her dog.</b></p>

  <p><b> What I need from you: a good idea or example of what you want and the remains that you want me to work with, if any. I will need about half a cup of Cremains. If you want cremains in both clay and glaze 
    I may need use all of the <a href="https://animalemementomori.com/Our%20Process.html">cremains</a>. Any remains I do not use will be returned to you with your work. Creamains tend to settle, so if you want a bone ash glaze it is important that the 
    cremains be mixed up before taking the amount I need to work with. Corser ashes can be used in the clay body, but I must have the fine ashes for a glaze.  Don't worry about sifting them, I do that as part of the process. And PLease, please, please mail the 
    remains with tracking and tell the shipper they are remains. Different shippers have differnt processes for it, USPS being the simplest in my experience </b></p>

  <p><b></b>If simply want a lovely urn than what I will need to know is 
  

<p><b>So how much will my piece cost? Cost comes down to the amount of time I spend on a piece. If it is something complicated then it takes more time.  My pricing is based solely on time spent and materials. 
  Below is a list off costs for added feautures  </b></p>


<p><b>



Costs:
  
Clay with cremains add: 30.00
Bone ash glaze with your cremains add: 50.00
Rush job, ie 30 days or less add: 100.00
<i>All prices are in USD.</i>
