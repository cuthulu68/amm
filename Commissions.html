       ï»¿<p><strong><i>IMPORTANT:</i></strong> Everything I make is custom and some options, such as bone ash glazes require more time for testing.
  Please look on the <a href="https://animalemementomori.com/Our%20Process.html" style="color: black;">process</a> page for details. Because of this it takes two to three months from time a deposit is placed until it ships. 
    Every piece I am commissioned for I take seriously and treat with respect. This takes time. </b></p>

<p>How do commissions work? All work requires a deposit. Deposits are 50% of the total price of the work, sans shipping. Please take a look <a href="https://https://animalemementomori.com/Our%20Process.html" style="color: black;">around</a> to get an idea of what you want and email me 
  at commissions@animalementomori.com and I'll give you a deposit cost based on what you want. Once you agree I will send an invoice.</p>
  
  <p>After you have made a deposit I like to sit down on a half hour call or video call and discuss who you want to memorialize and what they were like.  What makes you smile when you think of them? Was there something that was special between the two of you.
  For example, I made a coffee mug with cremains in the clay and bone ash glaze.  A mug was selected because they would get up every morning, let their dog out and then have a cup of coffee. The mug is a way that they continue to spend the morning together.
Another person loved to make a big bowl of ramen, sit in the dark with her dog and watch a horror movie. So in there case I made a ramen bowl so she can still have ramen with her dog. Another person wanted one of my sculptural pieces made with their cats cremains.
  A woman had her cat die suddenly. She asked for the remains to be made into a yarn bowl, so she could contuniue knitting with her cat next to her.</p>

  <p><strong>What I need from you</strong>: an example of what you want and the remains that you want me to work with, if any. I will need about half a cup of Cremains. If you want cremains in both clay and glaze 
    I may need to use all of the <a href="https://animalemementomori.com/Our%20Process.html"#cremains" style="color: black;"> cremains</a>. Any remains I do not use will be returned to you with your work. Cremains tend to settle, so if you want a bone ash glaze it is important that the 
    cremains be mixed up before taking the amount I need to work with. Corser ashes can be used in the clay body, but I must have the fine ashes for a glaze.  Don't worry about sifting them, I do that as part of the process.</b></p> 
  <p><b>And please, please, please mail the remains with tracking and tell the shipper they are remains. Different shippers have different processes for it, USPS being the simplest in my experience </b></p>
  <img src="USPS Creamins.jpg" hspace="20px" class="center">
  
  <p>If you simply want a lovely urn, than what I need is an example of what you want and the glaze colors picked from my availble colors list. Then email with the example, including size and example pic. I will get back to you with an estimated cost.</p> 

  <p>I also do human requests. I primamrly focus on animals as they are vastly underserved in comparison to humans. Also, I like animals more than people.</p> 
  

<p><strong>So how much will my piece cost?</strong></p> 
<p>Cost comes down to the amount of time I spend on a piece. If it is something complicated then it takes more time.  My pricing is based solely on time spent and materials. 
  Below is a list of costs for added features.</p>
