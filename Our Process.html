<h2><p></p>So what do I do, and what services do I offer?</p></h2>

<p><h2>Glazes</h2>h2></p>
<p>All of my glazes are made in house. Below are some test tiles of the colors I currently offer.  These are just standard glazes and not all of them play well together.  Such is the nature of glazes.
  I mention this because some color choices you make may not work well. If that is the case I will let you know. Also two of these, clear seafoam, clear light blue crazes (lots of tiny cracks).
  The reason why I offer this is I can add a complimentary colored stain in the cracks which really make it pop. People <i>really</i> seem to like it, so I offer it as an option now.</p>

<p><h2>Bone Ash Glazes</h2></p>
<p>As the name implies, these are glazes that use bone as a component. Bone ash is primarily calcium plus a few other things in small amounts. I use the fine ashes from the cremains to make these.
  Bone ash glazes can be temperamental, and thus less common on ceramics. The ones I offer are recipes I have tested extensively in my kiln, and I have a good confidence in. However, as these can be tricky,
  I will make a small test batch with your cremains before making a full batch in the color of your choice from below.  This option takes extra time, typically two weeks, since I run a test batch through a firing first.</p>

<p><h2>Cremians in Clay</h2></p>
<p>I will work the coarser ashes into the clay making up your piece. This typically will add a slight gritty texture to your piece. This will not add to the total time of making your item. Your item will still be food safe.</p>

<p><h2>Horse Hair Raku</h2><p>
<p>Raku is an old Japanese or Korean form of pottery, there’s some debate on where it started. Raku was used for roof tiles originally. It is made of what was considered a low quality clay that had tiny bits of ground up roof tiles in them.
  Waste not want, I guess. One of the qualities this clay has is it is very forgiving, relatively, of thermal expansion. This is what lets us rapidly bring the pieces up to temperature, then open up the kiln and pull them out while literally glowing red hot.
  From there we let it cool to the right temperature and then start applying horse hair. The thicker main and tail hairs work best for this.  They ignite instantly to wherever they are placed and leave very distinctive black carbon lines behind.
  There’s always a bit of chaos involved in this part so no two pieces are the same.  In addition I can add small speckle black spots and smokey effects as well as orange and yellow hues. 
  However, part of the beauty of Horse hair Raku is that it is more simple in nature. I can also do this with other pet fur, twisted into thin strands, however the lines will have a more smudged/smoky look to them.</p>


<p><h2>Sodium Silicate</h2></p>
<p>This is a process that allows me to add cracks to walls of the piece. I can also add colors on the outside prior to creating the cracking effect.  It can be very dramatic.</p>
