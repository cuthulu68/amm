  <h1><center><p>Welcome to Animale Memento Mori</p></center></h1>
  <h2><center><p><b>No one is truly gone if we remember them.  </b></p></center></h2>

<p><b>I wrote this site, yes with code and not a proprietary site builder. Quaint, isn't it? I wrote this site, becuase when people hear what I do I get a lot of questions.
    Hopefully purusing this site will answer many of those questions. </b></p>

<p><b>Please remember, I am a working potter, which means I have very little spare time. If I am slow to respond to general questions, read the pages on the site.
   Please don't take it personally if I do not promptly respond to your query.  I am a one man, three dog band, and Snitter has a decided lack of aptitude at the keyboard.
   As far as I can tell I am the only one that offers all of the services I do, which causes a bit of a demand for my work.
   Again, I politely ask you to click on the links above and see if you find the answer to your question(s). </b></p>
