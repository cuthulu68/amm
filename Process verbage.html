<p><b><i>IMPORTANT:</i>Everything I make is completely custom and some options, such as bone ash glazes require more time for testing.
  Please look on the <a href="https://animalemementomori.com/Our%20Process.html">process</a> page for details. Because of this it takes two to three months from time a deposit is placed until it ships. Every piece I am commissioned for I take seriously and treat with respect. This takes time. </b></p>


<p><b>So how much will my piece cost? Cost comes down to the amount of time I spend on a piece. If it is something complicated then it takes more time.  My pricing is based solely on time spent and materials.  </b></p>
